# *The outcome and important learning from the project:-* <br />

This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned a lot of things while working on this project and it gave us a lot of confidence. <br />
 This is our fourth collaborative project and we can say that it's one of our best collaborative projects. <br />
We learned a very important thing that how we work in a team. Although we could have done more, time did not allow us to go further. But we must improve it. I hope we do better in our next project. <br />
